Software construction involves the detailed creation of working software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging. It focuses on building software that meets the necessary requirements and performs reliably under various conditions.
Software configuration, on the other hand, is the process of defining and managing the settings and parameters of the software to ensure that it operates correctly within its environment. This involves configuring servers, networks, databases, and other components to work seamlessly together.
